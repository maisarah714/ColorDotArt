# ColorDotArt

Day 18 of 100 Days of Coding Challenge
The purpose of this project is to mimic the artwork of Damien Hirst using python.

## Feature
1. In this project, we learned how to draw random dots using turtle library
2. and extract most used color from an image using colorgram.py

Note for future reference: My coding is a bit different compared to the instructor;s coding. I'm using the method setposition using the turtle's coordinate, while the instructor's coding used setheading and forward method. Both are correct solution and does the same thing.
